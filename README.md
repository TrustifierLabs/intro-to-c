## Very very brief introduction to vim

In vim there are two modes of operation:

	1) Command Mode
	2) Edit Mode

The 'ESC' key puts you in 'command mode'
and the letters 'a', 'i' or 'o' put you in 'edit mode'

USE Letters J, K to move up and down
USE Letters H, L to move left and right
When you are in 'insert' mode the word -- INSERT -- appears at the bottom 

'<ESC>:w<ENTER>' will write a file to disk
'<ESC>:q<ENTER>' will quit the current editor, if it's the last editor it
		 will exit the program

'<ESC>ZZ'
